 Game Pitch
It's a simple combat racing game where players race through shifting tracks, collect power-ups, and use combat abilities to sabotage opponents.

 Key Mechanics
- Dynamic Arena Tracks â€“ The racecourse is randomly generated or shifts during gameplay, introducing new challenges like obstacles or shortcuts.  
- Boost & Nitro System â€“ Players can collect Nitro by performing stunts or near-misses, which can then be used for speed boosts.  
- Combat Racing â€“ Use simple attack mechanics like EMPs or missiles to disrupt opponents.  
- Track Hazards â€“ The track may contain randomly appearing obstacles, such as moving walls or traps that affect the race.  
- Upgrades & Power-ups â€“ Collect items during the race to enhance your vehicle's performance, like speed boosts, shields, or missile upgrades.
